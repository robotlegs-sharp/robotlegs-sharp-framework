Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to the original [Robotlegs Contributors](https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework/graphs/contributors) who developed the first and second revision of the framework. Your original source has been beautifully done with painfully complex patterns.

Thanks to all who have [contributed to this repository](https://github.com/robotlegs-sharp/robotlegs-sharp-framework/graphs/contributors). Without you this port would be vaporware.

And thanks to whomever is reading this text, if you are benefiting from this framework it's made the year writing this port worthwhile.
